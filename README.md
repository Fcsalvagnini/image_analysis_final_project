# Fingerprint Project

> This repository holds the source code for the Fingerprint Project developed during the Image Analysis Class (Institute of Computing - Unicamp, 1st Semester of 2022).

The fingerprint project is composed of 2 phases:

- Phase 1: Detecting the Region of Interest on images (Fingerprint) and cropping it through morphological operations
- Phase 2: Alignment of the Fingerprints and Detection of the individual to which the fingerprint belongs.

One can find the source code related to each phase in the folders src_phase_1 and src_phase_2. To compile and execute the source code, see the README.md inside each code folder.

The following students contributed to the development of this repository.
